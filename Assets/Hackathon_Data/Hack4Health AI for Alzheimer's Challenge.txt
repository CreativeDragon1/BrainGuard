Welcome, Innovators!
Welcome to the Hack4Health AI for Alzheimer's Challenge! We are thrilled to host our first hackathon focused on one of the most pressing healthcare challenges of our time. In line with our mission to democratize computational medicine, we are providing you with access to a real biomedical dataset, pragmatic tooling, and strong mentorship to help you make a tangible impact. We believe that the next breakthroughs in digital health will come from interdisciplinary builders like you, who can navigate the complexities of biomarkers, data pipelines, model validation, and translational storytelling.
This packet provides a comprehensive overview of the competition, including the problem, the dataset, potential technical approaches, and evaluation criteria. For the complete rules and regulations, please visit the official rules link below.
The Challenge: AI for Alzheimer's Detection
Brief Overview: Your challenge is to develop a machine learning model that accurately classifies Alzheimer's Disease from MRI scans. Alzheimer's is a neurodegenerative disease that is notoriously difficult to diagnose early. Recent advances in AI, particularly in deep learning, have shown promise in identifying subtle patterns in brain scans that can indicate the presence of the disease, even in its early stages.
The Dataset
For this competition, we will be using the "Alzheimer MRI Disease Classification Dataset". This dataset contains a series of MRI scans categorized into different stages of Alzheimer's Disease.
Dataset Path: /kaggle/input/alzheimer-mri-disease-classification-dataset
Specific File Path: .../Alzheimer MRI Disease Classification Dataset/Data/train-00000-of-00001-c08a401c53fe5312.parquet
We encourage you to perform thorough exploratory data analysis to understand the nuances of the data.
Getting Started: Essential Resources
To ensure you can hit the ground running, we've compiled a few key resources.
1. Starter Notebook:
To simplify data loading and initial processing, we have created a Google Colab notebook. This will handle the basic setup and allow you to focus on the more exciting parts of model development and analysis.
Access the Starter Colab here: Kaggle MRI Alzheimers
Instructions here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPRarAeelAM
2. Free GPU Access:
Training deep learning models on image data is computationally intensive. We highly recommend using free GPU resources to accelerate your model training.
Google Colab: Provides free access to GPUs. To enable it, open your notebook, go to Runtime -> Change runtime type, and select GPU from the "Hardware accelerator" dropdown.
Kaggle: Notebooks on Kaggle also offer free GPU access. You can enable it in the "Settings" tab of your notebook editor.
3. Ensuring Reproducibility:
Reproducibility is a cornerstone of good science. To ensure your results are consistent, it's crucial to set random seeds at the beginning of your code. This ensures that operations with a random element, like data shuffling or model weight initialization, produce the same result every time.
Here’s a sample code snippet to include at the start of your notebook:

Mentorship and Support
You are not alone in this challenge! We are committed to providing you with the support you need to succeed.
Weekly Mentor Sessions: We will be hosting weekly Q&A and mentorship sessions every [Day of the Week, e.g., Wednesday at 5 PM PST]. These sessions are a great opportunity to ask questions, get feedback on your approach, and learn from experienced mentors. A link will be sent out 24 hours prior to each session.
Async Support: For questions that come up between sessions and staying up to date, please join our Discord. Our mentors will be active there to provide guidance.
